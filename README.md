# TDS3751_SocialMediaCampaign

Social Media Campaign dashboard, dataset is collected from MalindoAir.

I do not take full credit of all the work done, as it was a four person assignment.

I was in charge of creating the dashboard and coding section of the assignment.

Nonetheless special thanks to all my teammates for supporting me.
